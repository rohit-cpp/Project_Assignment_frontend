## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### üç™ CORS or Cookie Issues
**Symptoms**: Authentication not working, 401 errors on protected routes
**Solutions**: 
- Verify backend CORS configuration allows frontend origin with credentials
- Ensure axios withCredentials is properly configured
- Check browser Network tab for cookie transmission

### üìä Scoring Issues
**Symptoms**: Incorrect or lower than expected scores
**Solutions**:
- Verify answer indices are 0-based and match option order
- Check submit payload includes all selected answers
- Ensure consistent question ID formatting between frontend and backend

### ‚è∞ Timer Synchronization
**Symptoms**: Timer doesn't match server expectations
**Solutions**:
- Remember backend is authoritative for time limits
- Consider implementing periodic server time sync
- Use client timer primarily for user experience

### üîÑ State Persistence Problems
**Symptoms**: Losing progress on browser refresh
**Solutions**:
- Verify localStorage keys and data format
- Check submissionId consistency across components
- Ensure proper cleanup after exam submission

### üîê Authentication Issues
**Symptoms**: Login works but protected routes fail
**Solutions**:
- Verify cookie domain and path settings
- Check SameSite and Secure cookie attributes
- Ensure proper error handling in auth context

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting service
3. Configure environment variables in hosting dashboard
4. Set up proper redirects for single-page application routing

### Environment Configuration
- Update `VITE_API_URL` to point to production backend
- Ensure `VITE_EXAM_ID` matches production exam data
- Configure proper CORS origins on backend for production domain

### Backend Integration
